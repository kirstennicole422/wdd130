                <h2>History</h2>
                <p class="left">Company history: Our company started back in 1986 by adventure loving Fabian Johnson. The company is now ran by his son, Charles, and daugher-in-law, Sarah. Charles grew up on the river and was thrilled to take over the business to share his love of the outdoors with as many people as he can. </p>
                <img src = "images/raft1.webp" alt = "" width = 200>
                <p class="right">Our small team is an extention of the Johnson family. Many of our guides are the children and grandchileren of the original guides. Each has their own story to tell about how they fell in love with rafting. Be sure to ask about your guide's story on your next tour!</p>
