            <p> Colorado is the Centennial State. It was admitted to the union in 1876, 100 years after the Declaration of Independence was signed. The Colorado flag has blue stripes representing the wide blue skies, a white stripe representing the snow capped mountains. The "C" in the center of the flag is red for the red rocks found in the state and the gold circle represents the sunshine Colorado receives. </p>
